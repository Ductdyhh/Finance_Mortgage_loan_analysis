# Finance and e-Commerce Data Analysis

This repository contains exploratory data analysis and modeling projects for two domains:

- **Mortgage Loan Analysis** (`Finance_Mortgage_loan_analysist.ipynb`): Predicting loan defaults using logistic regression and random forest models. Includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, hyperparameter tuning and evaluation.
- **e-Commerce Payment Analysis** (`e_commerce.ipynb`): Examines payment data to predict payment values with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models. Provides insights into payment types and dataset characteristics.

Both notebooks were created in Google Colab and use common Python data science libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn` and `matplotlib`.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Finance_Mortgage_loan_analysis
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies (for example via pip):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```
3. Open either notebook in Jupyter or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to explore the analyses and run the code.
